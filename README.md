# SQ-Simple
A simple SQLite db browser tool with a simple grid

This is not a complete database browser, it's one of my learning projects. I use this little app to quickly create and edit SQLite databases. It has not many functions, maybe someone would like to help and add needed functions. 

The app has also a datagrid window to change some data, if needed.

I designed it (sizes and icons) for MacOS, but there is no reason that it does not work under Windows.
